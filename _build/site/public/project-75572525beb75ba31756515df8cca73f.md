# Introduction

Running train.py using my laptop would (according to my calculations) have taken about 3 days. Instead, I will be using google colab to run the notebook files, which I will then download and add in the Notebooks folder of this project. 

This website is a [Myst document](https://mystmd.org/), which allows me to write about some of the changes I made to the `train.py` file in a structured way, combining the outputs of codecells with markdown text. For any figure, the `source : ...` will be displayed in the top right corner. Clicking on this will navigate the page to the source notebook file. 

This project contains the following files: 
- Initial run - No changes made to the code, only for logging purposes. 
- First step - I changed the optimiser to AdamW
- Second step - 

# Initial run

We first run train.py to check the validation loss to beat.
