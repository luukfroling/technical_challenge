# Introduction

Running train.py using my laptop would (according to my calculations) have taken about 3 days. Instead, I will be using google colab to run the notebook files, which I will then download and add in the Notebooks folder of this project. 

This website is a [Myst document](https://mystmd.org/), which allows me to write about some of the changes I made to the `train.py` file in a structured way, combining the outputs of codecells with markdown text.
