# Maincode technical challenge - Mainrun 

This website is build using [Myst](https://mystmd.org/), which lets me write about changes I made to `train.py` in a structured way, combining code-cell outputs with markdown text. For any figure, a `source : ...` button will appear in the top right corner, clicking it will jump directly to the original notebook file.

The goal of this project is:

> Your task is to analyze and improve the training run of a small GPT-2 style model. The code is designed to train on a Hacker News headline dataset. Your goal is to minimize the validation loss as low as possible within 7 epochs. The baseline to beat is a validation loss of 1.754.

Where I aim to:
- Minimise the validation loss. 
- Understand how well the model performs.
